# Digit-recognizer
The human visual system is a wonder of the world. People can easily recognise numbers. But it is not as simple as it seems. The human brain has a million neurons and billions of connections between them, making this exceptionally complex task of image processing easy. People can recognise numbers effortlessly.  Recognising numbers, on the other hand, becomes a real challenge for computers. Simple intuitions about how to recognise numbers become difficult to express algorithmically. In addition, handwriting varies considerably from person to person, making the task extremely complex.  A handwritten digit recognition system involves training a machine to recognise digits from different sources such as e-mails, bank cheques, papers, pictures, etc.
